## Reference Materials

- [A great article about the FAA's methodology toward attitude flying](https://www.avweb.com/news/airman/184208-1.html)

## Instrument Scan 

- Most round-dial panels are arranged in a "T" pattern:

- A common glass-panel primary-flight display (PFD, left) and multi-function display (MFD, right):

- Note, glass cockpit tape representation have generally less "glance value" than round-dial gauges
- Common problems with instrument scan: 
	- Omission: Not using an instrument or category of instruments
		- This may often happen with the performance instruments (airspeed and tachometer)
	- Emphasis: Relying too heavily on a single instrument
		- Common with attitude indicator
	- Fixation: Starting on a single instrument
		- Common with altimeter while leveling-off after climb
		- Also common with the heading indicator when rolling out of a turn

## Fundamental Maneuvers

### Straight and Level

- Different pitch and power setting will produce straight and level flight at different airspeeds

Instrument focus in straight-and-level flight:

				<li>Heading Indicator</li>
				<li>Turn Rate Indicator</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Note that the *trend* instruments usually have a several-second delay in their indication. This may not happen on glass displays however. 

#### Altitude Correction 

We use the horizontal pitch bar on the attitude indicator to correct deviations in altitude: 

- < 100 deviation from altitude
	- 1/2 bar pitch change
- \> 100 foot deviation from altitude
	- 1 bar pitch correction

#### Heading Correction 

- For deviations < 5 degrees
	- Use rudder only to correct
- \> 5 degree deviation
	- Bank no more than 1/2 the number of degrees you want to turn
	- However, do not bank more than standard rate

#### Airspeed Correction

- Adjust the power setting to the predetermined level which will give you the desired airspeed
- Adjust the pitch altitude to maintain level flight

### Constant Airspeed Climbs and Descents

**Climbs**:

- Pitch up to the predetermined position above the horizon bar
- Increase the power to the climb setting
- Adjust right-rudder pressure to maintain coordinated flight
- Use pitch to maintain the desired airspeed, leaving power constant
- Begin the level-off from the climb when you nearing your target altitude: 
	- Generally, for a 500 fpm climb, level off 50 feet before the target altitude

**Descents**:

- Pull out power to the predetermined setting
- Maintain altitude with pitch and allow the airspeed to bleed off until the desired airspeed is reached, then lower the nose
- Correct the airspeed with pitch *and* power
- Level off before reach 
	- Lead the level off by ~10% of the rate of descent
	- E.g. for a descent of 500 fpm, start leveling off 50 feet above the target altitude

### Constant Rate Climbs

- Pitch up to the predetermined position above the horizon bar
- Increase the power to the climb setting
- Use the vertical speed indicator as the primary **pitch** instrument
- Use the airspeed indicator as the primary **power** instrument

### Turns

- The faster your airplane, the steeper the bank that is required for a standard rate turn
- Know the bank angle required for a standard rate turn
- You can estimate the bank needed by dividing the *TAS* in knots by 10, and then adding 7

#### Timed Turns

- To check the turn indicator:
	- *Establish* a standard rate turn
	- Start your timer when on a cardinal header
	- After 1 minute, you should have turned 180 degrees (3 degrees per second)
- For a timed turn, divide the number of degrees you wish to turn by three (e.g. for 60 degrees to the right, you'll want 20 seconds)
	- You will turn some amount during the roll in to the turn; this amount is usually between 1/3 and 1/2 the degrees of *bank* used
	- After the set amount of time, roll out of the turn

#### Steep Turns

- Steep turns require a rapid scan
- They will often require additional power to maintain altitude

## Flying in Turbulence

- Recall that airplanes are more stable in pitch than they are in bank, thus it will be more difficult to keep the wings level than the pitch stable in turbulence. 

> An altitude alert will be triggered to ATC when you have departed at least 300 feet from your assigned altitude. 

- It's important to make a timely **altitude** correction than a *heading* correction
- Types of turbulence: 
	- Convective turbulence: 
		- Up and down draft
		- Airspeed will vary 
	- Windshear turbulence: 
		- Dramatic airspeed variations
	- Orographic turbulence: 
		- Up and down drafts
- Focus less on airspeed deviation than altitude and heading deviations
- In rough air, plan to fly at maneuvering speed or lower

> If you are unable to maintain altitude within 100 feet, you can request a *block altitude* from ATC. E.g. 5000 to 6000 feet.
