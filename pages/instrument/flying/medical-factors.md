## Oxygen Use

> Hypoxia is the inadequate supply of oxygen to the bodyâ€™s tissues.

- As altitude increases, the *partial pressure* of oxygen decrease
	- Although the proportion of air that is oxygen is the same
	- The amount of oxygen that the blood can absorb depends mostly on the pressure the oxygen exerts on the blood as it passes through the lungs
- The body lacking sufficent oxygen is called *hypoxia*
	- Ischemic hypoxia: Reduction of blood flow through tissues
	- Histotoxic hypoxia: Inability of tissues to utilize oxygen (often caused by drugs or alcohol)
	- Hypemic (anemic) hypoxia: Reduction of the carrying capacity of oxygen by the the blood (can be caused by CO inhalation)
	- Hypoxic hypoxia: Reduction of oxygen entering the blood (caused by reduced pressure)
- Altitude effects
	- 10,000 feet: Blood can still transport 90% of the oxygen
	- 18,000 feet: Can cause collapse
- Symptoms of hypoxia
	- Dizziness
	- Tingling of the skin
	- Blue nails (cyanosis)
	- Increased heart rate
	- Vision narrow and blurs
	- Personality changes
- Time of useful consciousness
	- 25,000: 2 minutes
	- 35,000: 1 minute or less


- Part 91 Rules:
	- Above 15,000 feet *pressure altitude*: All occupants must use supplemental oxygen 
	- Above 14,000 feet: All required crew members must use supplemental oxygen
	- Above 12,500 feet: All required crew members must use supplemental oxygen if fly for more than 30 minutes
- Part 135 Rules:
	- Above 10,000 feet, after 30 minutes: Used by each pilot
	- Above 12,000 feet: Used continuously
- Note that most pilots need supplemental oxygen below 12,000 feet; usually above 8-9,000 feet 
- At night, the necessity is greater
