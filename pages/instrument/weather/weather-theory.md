- The amount of water the air can hold *doubles* with every 11 degree increase in temperature

## Surface Weather Prognosis Chart

- Isobars are shown, which are lines of *constant pressure*

## Upper Level Constant Pressure Charts

- 500mb chart is around 18,000 feet
- The entire chart is **constant pressure**, and the lines on the chart represent altitudes
- Highs and low refer to altitudes, not pressures

- The wind usually parallels the contours
- Cold air aloft will be brought down, counter clockwise around the low, and drawn over warm air at the surface
	- This causes instability
	- The more rapidly the air cools, the greater the instability
	- Moist air wraps up and around the low
	- Sometimes called "upper level support"

## Below Minimum Weather

- Most ILS approaches have a 200 ft DH and require a 1/2 mile visibility, or 1800 ft. RVR (about 3/8 of a mile)
- Most non-precision approaches have 400-600 foot MDAs and 1 mile visibility
- NDB minimums are typically 500-900 ft. AGL, can be as low as 350 AGL without terrain
- VOR minimums are could be as low as 250 ft MDA


- Most below-minimum conditions are caused by fog
	- Advection fog: Warmer moist air (perhaps off a body of water) moves over cold ground
	- Radiation fog (ground fog): 
		- Forms on clear nights with light or no wind
		- A small temp/dewpoint spread
		- The lower you go, the *less* you see
- Fog cannot be "burned off" by the sun if there are overlaying cloud layers above the fog
- When taking off in fog, pick a takeoff alternate that has weather above landing minimums

- Warm rain falling into colder air may also produce fog
- Rain also creates low "scud"
	- 1 sm vis, 200 scattered, 800 ovc
	- Scud can preclude a circling approach
- The vast majority of IFR accidents occurs on approach, more so even on ILS approaches

> It is the pilot's prerogative to shoot an approach when the airport reports below-minimum weather. 

- FAR 91.175 states that the *flight visibility* must be at least the minimums listed on the chart, and only the pilot can judge the flight visibility

> As a general rule, do *not* shoot more than one approach (and definitely don't try to "make the approach work"). Also, don't attempt an approach if the airport is reporting below minimum weather. 

## Turbulence 

- Try to avoid all fair-weather cumulus, if you can
- Categories
	- Light: 
		- Momentary changes in altitude or attitude
		- Occupants may feel a strain against the seat belts
	- Light Chop:
		- Rhythmic light turbulence
	- Moderate:
		- Definite strains against your belts
		- Unsecured items are dislodged
	- Moderate chop: 
		- Rapid jumps or jolts *without* appreciable attitude changes
	- Severe:
		- Substantial changes in attitude and altitude
		- Strained tightly against your belts
	- Extreme Turbulence
		- Violently tossed about
		- Practically impossible to control
		- Damage possible 
- Rotor:
	- Wind increasing with altitude against a ridge, causing wave on the downwind side
	- Note that an MEA will put you 2,000 feet above the ridge level
- Significant turbulence in occluded fronts and troughs aloft
- Don't fly at an MEA when it is within 4000-6000 feet of your airplane service ceiling
- Fly Va or maneuvering speed in turbulence
	- The speed at which the airplane will stall before the critical load factor is reached
	- The maneuvering speed decreases as weight decreases, due to the relative wing loadings


## Middle Altitude Weather

- You'll need to pay careful attention to the winds aloft
	- In the winter, it is possible to see wind speeds of up to 100 knots in the teens
- Best westbound strategy: Climb to and maintain smooth air
- Ice can be a problem in the middle altitudes
	- Usually near warn fronts (especially in the summer)
- Be careful that you don't put too much weather between your airplane and the ground; you'll have to descend through it eventually
- Wind shear turbulence aloft: Clear air turbulence
- Closed low aloft (Cutoff Low)
	- Seen on 500mb chart
	- Expect clear air turbulence
	- Difficult to forecast the low
	- Thus, it's difficult to predict surface weather

## Nighttime Weather

> Usually the best course of action is to get on the ground if the weather is bad at night. 

- Bad conditions usually tend to get worse as the night goes on

## Wind Shear

> The first sign of a wind-shear encounter is a sudden change in indicated airspeed.

> The changing of wind does not usually affect an aircraft in flight. However, it *will* affect the airplane if the wind changes faster than the airplane's mass can be accelerated. 

### Wind Shear on Approach

- If a *headwind* becomes a *tailwind*:
	- The airspeed will fall, and the airplane will pitch downward
	- This means you will need to add power to maintain your glideslope
	- However, after it is stabilized, you must reduce power to a *lower* setting than before the shear
- If a *tailwind* becomes a *headwind*:
	- The airspeed will increase, and the pitch will increase
	- You must reduce power
	- However, after it is stabilized, you must add additional power than before the shear

### Low-Level Windshear

- Found in:
	- Thunderstorms
	- Fronts
		- Cold front passage:
			- Applicable up to 3 hours after the passage of a cold front, and up to 5000 feet
		- Warm front passage:
			- Usually a greater amount of shear, and lower to surface
			- Applicable right after passage of the front and for up to 6 hours
		- Be weary of:
			- Frontal speeds of 30 knots or more
			- Temperature difference of 5 degrees C on the surface on opposite sides of the front
			- When the wind between 2000 and 4000 feet is >= 25 knots
	- Low-level inversions
	- Mountain wave

### Microbursts

> It's best to avoid microbursts.

![Microbust](https://www.weather.gov/images/bmx/Daily/microbursts/microburst.jpg)

- Microburst development
	- Descends as a rain shaft, then intensified for the first 5 minutes after contacting the ground
	- Surface winds can change as must as 100 knots on the ground
	- The maximum shear intensity occurs 10 minutes after contacting the ground
	- Horizontal outflow usually has a radius of 3 or so miles
	- Formation of multiple or a line of microbursts is common
	- Expect microbursts anywhere near convective activities
- Likely in convective weather, with:
	- Strong winds
	- Heavy precipitation
	- Virga
	- Moderate or severe turbulence
	- **15-30 degrees C** between the temperature and the dewpoint
	- PIREP of IAS change of 15 or more knots
- Compensatory measures 
	- Many towers have LLWS alerting system
	- Takeoff considerations:
		- Use the longest suitable runway
		- Use the maximum power available
		- Consider a higher speed for takeoff
	- Landing considerations:
		- Stabilize an approach above 1000 feet AGL
		- Avoid large power reductions
		- Consider a higher approach speed
