title: Airframe Icing
---

- Ice buildup on an aircraft can alter the shape of its airfoil
	- Decreases the angle of attack at which the aircraft will stall
	- Can also increase drag by 100% or more
- 

> Airframe icing forms when super-cooled water droplets strike the aircraft. This water has been lifted from a warmer area into a colder one. 

- Thus, the most likely scenario to encounter icing is where there is *moisture* and *lifting action*
	- This often occurs around a low pressure system
		- Air flows clockwise and up *into* the low
	- Orographic lift can also cause icing (E.g. air being forced upward over a ridge)
		- This effect can be much stronger than that of a low pressure system

> If the air is turbulent and you encounter ice, it will likely be severe.

- In cumulus clouds: 
	- Expect more rapid accumulation
	- You can sometimes go around them
- In stratus clouds: 
	- More gradual accumulation
	- Cover a much wider area
	- An altitude change may help
	- Ice will generally not form if the temperature is below -15 degrees C

- Expect icing: 
	- In rain or visible moisture (like cloud droplets)
	- The temperature is within 2 degrees C and -10 degrees C

### Ice Types 

![Types of Ice](https://www.aviationweather.ws/page093-1.jpg)

#### Clear Ice

- Glossy and transparent
- Forms most often with: 
	- Temperatures close to the freezing point with large amounts of water
	- High aircraft speed
	- Large water droplets
- Typically found in: 
	- Supercooled water in cumulus clouds
	- Very unstable air
	- Strong mechanical lifting over mountains
 
#### Rime Ice

- Forms most often with: 
	- Low temperatures
	- Low aircraft speeds
	- Less liquid water
- Typically found in: 
	- Small supercooled droplets in stratus clouds
	- Stable air

#### Mixed Ice

- Ice that is a combination of both rime and clear ice

#### Light Rime Ice

- Accumulates slowly in Stratus clouds 5-10 degrees below freezing

#### Freezing Rain

> Don't fly in freezing rain.

- Rain that falls from warm air above into colder air below, causing it to freeze
- Ofter you should attempt to climb up into the warmer air if freezing rain is encountered
- The *lower* you fly the *worse* the ice will become
- Usually occurs north of a warm front
	- Fly back over the warm front for relief
	- However, be weary of embedded thunderstorms along the cold front

### Encountering Ice

- Disable the autopilot (which can mask performance changes in the airplane)
- Roll upset may occur when ice causes a stall at the tip of the wing, causes an aileron self-deflection
	- In this case, level the wings, increase airspeeds, and extend flaps one notch
	- Set appropriate power
	- Don't retract the flaps
		- This will *increase* the angle of attack
	- Turn on ice protection, if installed
- A tailplane stall is a stall due to ice of the horizontal stabilizer
	- Symptoms
		- Elevator pulsing
		- Nose-down trim change
		- Abnormal pitch anomalies
		- Reduction/Loss of elevator effectiveness
		- Sudden change in elevator force
		- Sudden commanded nose-down pitch movement
	- Remedy
		- Retract flaps to the previous setting
		- Increase airspeed
		- Apply sufficient power
		- Make nose-down pitch changes slowly
- If you have ice on the airplane:
	- Make your approach at a higher-than-normal speed
	- Don't use flaps!
	- Use an ILS if you can

### PIREPS for Icing

- Be weary of PIREPS from much high performance aircraft
	- Faster aircraft have a much warmer skin due to the friction of the passing air
- Also be sure to look at the time of the report
- Ice Intensity:
	- Trace icing
		- Ice is just barely perceptible
		- Accumulation is slightly faster than the sublimation
		- Anti-ice is not used unless encountered for more than 1 hour
	- Light icing
		- Hazardous if flown in form more than an hour
		- Calls for the use of anti-ice equipment, but does not pose a hazard when its used
	- Moderate icing
		- Potentially hazardous if anti-ice is not used immediately
		- Diversion may be necessary
	- Severe Icing: 
		- Exceeds the capability of approved anti-ice equipment

### Deicing Systems

- Boots
	- Push pressurized air into inflatable boots on the leading edge
- Weeping wing
	- Pours leading edge (anti-ice and deice)
- Heated wing
	- Uses bleed air from jet engines
- Propeller
	- Heated element (deice)
	- Fluid discharger (anti-ice)
- Windshields
	- Anti-ice fluid nozzles
	- Electrically heated windshield plate 
- FIKI Certification
	- Must be functional and unmodified
- Partial ice protection systems
	- Used for *emergency use only*
