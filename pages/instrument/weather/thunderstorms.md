title: Thunderstorms
---

- Greatest turbulence is found on the outskirts of the storm
	- Where the updrafts (on the edges) meet the down drafts (in the core)
- Greatest turbulence is on the *front* side of the storm

- Vertical gust tolerances
	- Propeller aircraft: 30-50 fps
	- Jet aircraft: 66 fps
	- Moderate turbulence: 20 fps gusts
	- Severe turbulence: 30 fps gusts
- Lighter wing loading -> More susceptible to gusts
- The *gust front*m where the frontal downdrafts are felt on the ground by a shift in the wind, can extend up to 15-20 miles out in front of a storm
- Embedded thunderstorms are usually in warm or stationary frontal zones
- Stay at least *5nm* away
- If it's a serious storm stay *20nm* away

## Requirements

1. Lifting Action
2. Instability
3. Moisture

- Types of thunderstorms
	- Airmass: 
		- Lifting from convective heating or orographic lift
	- Frontal
		- Squall lines

## Stages

- Cumulus
	- Mostly updrafts
- Mature
	- precipitation begins
	- Updrafts and downdrafts
- Dissipating
	- Mostly downdrafts

## Forecasts

- Lines of thunderstorms at least 60 miles long
- Area covering 3,000 square miles covering at least 40% of that area
- Embedded or sever thunderstorms
- Special issuances: 
	- Tornadoes
	- Hail > 3/4"
	- Wind gusts greater than 50 knots
	- Indication of rapidly changing conditions
