## Vacuum and Pressure Instruments

- Attitude and heading indicators are the **vacuum instruments**
	- Each contain a gyro, which is spun by a partial vauccm
	- Some attach a vacuum pump to create negative pressure (drawing air in to spin the gyro), while some force air in with a positive pressure pump
	- For light aircraft, this is usually done using a vacuum system
	- Most dry vacuum pumps have a lifetime between 500-1000 hours
	- Dirty air filters can slow the spinning of the gyros
	- Be sure to include the **suction gauge** as part of your instrument scan

## Partial Panel Flight

- 3 main categories of failure
	- Vacuum
		- Heading and attitude indicator becomes inoperative
			- The AI is usually the first to go, and often show a nose-low, banking attitude as the gyro loses momentum
			- Cross-check instruments to corroborate evidence of a failure
		- In a glass cockpit, partial failures may cause the loss of a single component
	- Pitot/Static
		- Erroneous altimeter, vertical speed, or airspeed readings
	- Electrical
		- The turn coordinator is usually electrically powered

## Magnetic Compass

- On *northerly* headings, the compass will **lag** behind the actual heading
- On *southernly* headings, the compass will **lead** the actual heading
- On any heading other than north or south, *acceleration* will show a header **north** of the real heading, and a *deceleration* will shown a heading **south** of the real heading

## Transponders

- Primary radar simply shows airborne objects (which could be a flock of birds)
- Traditional transponders broadcast on 1090 MHz, and respond to interrogation from a *secondary* radar station or another aircraft's TCAS system
	- Mode C adds altitude reporting, so your aircraft altitude is send back with your response
- ADBS-B is part of the NextGen ATC system
	- ADS-B Out: Transmits your GPS positions, altitude, and ground speed to one of over 700 ground stations
		- This is done either with either a new protocol on top of 1090 MHz, or using a new technology called UAT that uses 978 MHz
	- ADS-B In: An optional data link that allows your aircraft to receive ADBS-B out data from other aircraft, and receive FIS-B weather data from ground stations:
		- Allows aircraft to receive traffic information (TIS-B)
		- Allows aircraft to receive weather information (FIS-B)

### ADBS-B 2020 Mandate

- Required in Class A airspace
- Within 30nm of a Class B airport
- Within and above Class C airspace
- Above 10,000 MSL but not below 2,500 AGL in Class E airspace
