## Vacuum and Pressure Instruments

- Attitude and heading indicators are the **vacuum instruments**
	- Each contain a gyro, which is spun by a partial vauccm
	- Some attach a vacuum pump to create negative pressure (drawing air in to spin the gyro), while some force air in with a positive pressure pump
	- For light aircraft, this is usually done using a vacuum system
	- Most dry vacuum pumps have a lifetime between 500-1000 hours
	- Dirty air filters can slow the spinning of the gyros
	- Be sure to include the **suction gauge** as part of your instrument scan

## Partial Panel Flight

- 3 main categories of failure
	- Vacuum
		- Heading and attitude indicator becomes inoperative
			- The AI is usually the first to go, and often show a nose-low, banking attitude as the gyro loses momentum
			- Cross-check instruments to corroborate evidence of a failure
		- In a glass cockpit, partial failures may cause the loss of a single component
	- Pitot/Static
		- Erroneous altimeter, vertical speed, or airspeed readings
	- Electrical
		- The turn coordinator is usually electrically powered

## Magnetic Compass

- On *northerly* headings, the compass will **lag** behind the actual heading
- On *southernly* headings, the compass will **lead** the actual heading
- On any heading other than north or south, *acceleration* will show a header **north** of the real heading, and a *deceleration* will shown a heading **south** of the real heading
