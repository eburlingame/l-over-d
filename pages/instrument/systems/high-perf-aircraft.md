## Turbocharging 

- Normally aspirated engines loose power with altitude, as the air gets thinner

> Turbochargers are turbines that increase the pressure of engine's intake air. 

- The compressor is also used to pressurize the cabin

- Types
	- Sea level engines: Can only produce their rated power at sea level
	- Altitude engine: Supercharges/turbo charged, and can maintain their rated power above sea level
		- Altitude turbocharger (or normalized) engines
			- Uses a turbocharger to maintain sea-level power at high altitudes (but doesn't go beyond that)
		- Ground boosted engines
			- Increases the pressure, even at sea-level
			- These engines have to be more robust (better heat dissipation and lubrication)
			- Too much manifold pressure is called *over-boosting*
- The *critical altitude* is the altitude at which the engine can produce maximum continuous power, or the maximum allowable manifold pressure
- Using a higher pressure and higher temperature input air causes the engine to run hotter
	- Some systems incorporate an *intercooler*, which cools the compressed air before it is pumped into the cylinders
	- Usually, subtract 1" manifold pressure for each 15 degree C drop in intake air pressure
- Turbine speed is governed by a *wastegate*
	- This valve controls the amount of exhaust that is directed into the turbocharger
	- Some airplanes tie the wastegate to the throttle
		- Here, you adjust the throttle to maintain a safe manifold pressure
- Some airplane do not have a wastegate
	- Instead they have a pressure relief valve that will let out air when the exhaust pressure gets too high
	- Some will control the wastegate via pressure sensors in other parts of the system

## Pressurization

> A pressurization system pumps air into the cabin at a rate faster than the air can escape.

- These systems can maintain a maximum *pressure differential*
	- With a 3.3 PSI differential:
		- At 7,000 feet: The cabin is at sea level pressure
		- At 25,000 feet: The cabin will be at 12,100 pressure altitude
