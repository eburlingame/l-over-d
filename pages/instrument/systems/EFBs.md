## Electronic EFBs

The FAA has established FARs that govern the use of Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs) in the cockpit.

- FAR 91.21 states that you must ensure that the EFB will not interfere with the navigation/communication systems installed on the aircraft
- AC91-78 give guidance on replacing paper charts:
	- Need an application that will display paper charts 
	- **The charts and data must be kept current**
	- Recommends bringing a backup paper or second EFB, but this is not a requirement
	- Also recommends a trial period where you use both paper and electronic
