## Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs)

- Graphical departure procedures for standardized traffic flow
	- First page is the graphical deception of the routing
	- The second page is a text description of the routing

- Each SID has a **top altitude**, which is the altitude that the departure will transition you to. 

> A controller may issue you a **climb via** departure clearance:
- Here, you are required to comply with the *altitude crossing restrictions* on the chart
- "Climb via the HAWWC2 departure, IKAYE transition, then as filed"


- Mandatory departure routes are depicted with *thick* black arrows on the departure chart
	- *Transition routes* are depicted with *thin* black arrows

- Note: 
	- You cannot fly a SID without an ATC clearance. 
	- If you do not wish to fly a SID, say "No SIDs" in the remarks section of your flight plan

## Obstacle Departure Procedures (OBPs)

- ODBs may be textual or graphical
	- Textual ODPs are listed under takeoff minimums
	- Graphic ODPs are listed with SIDs/STARs, and will be titled "____ Departure (Obstacle)"
- You do not need a clearance to fly an ODP, and you should plan to fly them by default (unless you are given other routing/vectoring by ATC)

## Alternate Takeoff Minimums 

> An inverted "T" on an approach chart means there is *either* an obstacle departure procedure, or alternate takeoff minimums <br><br>

Note that non-standard takeoff minimums do **not** apply for Part 91, not-for-hire traffic


### Low, Close-in Obstacles

- Up to 200 feet tall 
- WIthin 1nm of the runway
- *Doesn't* require increased takeoff minimums
- Avoid these visually, or be sure you have enough performance to climb over them

- Note: *DER* = Departure End of the Runway 

## Standard Takeoff Minimums 

Only for "for hire" operations: 

- Aircraft with 1 or 2 engines: 
	- 1 sm visbility
- Aircraft with 3 or 4 engines:
	- 1/2 sm visbility 

The FAA uses a 40:1 slope starting at the departure (152 ft. per nm slope) and of the runway to determine obstacle clearance.

> The standard IFR minimum climb gradient is 200 feet per nm.
- At 90 knots *ground speed*, this is **300 FPM**
- At 120 knots *ground speed*, this is **425 FPM**
