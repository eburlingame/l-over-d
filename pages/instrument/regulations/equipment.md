## Pilot Currency 

> To act as PIC under IFR, the pilot must hold an instrument rating and meet the required recent experience. 

### Recency Experience

- The pilot must have within the preceding **6 months**, under actual or simulated conditions, logged:
	- 6 instrument approaches
	- Holding procedures
	- Interception and tracking of courses through navigational systems
- If you let your currency lapse (do not do the above in 6 months):
	- You are no longer legal to fly under IFR
	- You must complete those 6 approaches, holds, and tracking with a safety pilot, or in an ATD
- If you let you currency lapse for 12 months (without doing the above)
	- You must take an **instrument proficiency check (IPC)**
	- An IPC contains most of the tasks from the practical test

#### Other Considerations

- Contact or visual approaches do not count
- All the experience must be in the same category of aircraft, or in an ATD that is representative of the aircraft category
- An AATD may be used for currency, however:
	- The currency is valid only for 2 calendar months
	- You must also have 3 hours of instrument experience
	- Perform 4 unusual attitude recoveries in the ATD

- Logging instrument time
	- Include the *airport* and type of approach made
	- The name of the safety pilot (if used)


#### Safety Pilots

- A safety pilot must be:
	- At least a private pilot
	- Have a valid medical
	- Be rated and current in the aircraft flown

## Required Equipment

### VFR 

- FAR 91.205 specifics day VFR equipment:
	- Airspeed indicator
	- Altimeter
	- Magnetic compass
	- Tachometer
	- Oil pressure and oil temperature gauges
	- Fuel gauge
	- Anti-collision lights
	- Safety belts
	- ELT
	- Gear indicator (if needed)
	- Manifold pressure gauge (altitude engine)
	- Coolant temperature gauge (liquid-cooled engine)

- FAR 91.205 specifics night VFR equipment:
	- Position lights
	- Landing lights
	- Adequate energy source
	- Spare fuses (if equipped)

### IFR Flight

- FAR 91.205 specifics that all VFR equipment is required for IFR flight, and also requires:
	- 2 way communication radio
	- Navigation suitable for the route flown
	- Gyroscopic rate-of-turn indicator
		- Not applicable to some aircraft with a 3rd attitude indicator
		- Under part 91, you may also substitute a secondary attitude indicator for the rate-of-turn indicator in light airplanes
	- Slip-skid indicator
	- Sensitive altimeter (Barometric altimeter)
	- Clock with sweeping seconds or digital representation
	- Generator or alternator
	- Directional gyro (heading indicator)
	- DME or RNV (for FL240 and above)
	- VOR or TACAN, or RNAV (within Class B)
		- E.g. an IFR-approves GPS 

## Required Inspections

- These inspections are required for flight under IFR, list in detail below:
	- VOR receiver check (30 days)
	- Aircraft annual inspection (12 months)
	- Transponder inspection (24 months)
	- GPS databases (Up-to-date)
	- Altimeter/Encoder/Static Pressure System Inspection (24 months)


### VOR Receivers

> VOR receivers be checked to be within limits within the preceding **30 days**. 

- To check the VOR, use these methods (in the preferable order)
	- VOT Test facilities:
		- Always transmit the 360 degree radial
		- +/- 4 degree tolerance
	- Designated surface checkpoint
		- Listed in the AFD
		- Shown on a taxiway
		- +/- 4 degree tolerance
	- Designated airborne checkpoint
		- Listed in the AFD
		- You must be over a specified checkpoint
		- +/- 6 degree tolerance
	- Dual VOR receiver check
		- You must have two VOR receivers which are *independent* with everything except the antenna
		- Set the both receivers to the same station and same bearing
		- +/- 4 degree tolerance between the two CDIs
		- You must use a **TO** signal here
- Enter the VOR check in the logbook:
	- P: Place of the check
	- A: Amount of error
	- D: Date of the check
	- S: Your signature

### IFR-Approved GPS

>  Required to have:
- **Current databases**, if it is to be used for approached
- An **approved flight manual (AFM)** for the unit

### Transponder

> For use under IFR, the transponder must be checked by an approved avionics facility every **24 calendar months**. 

### Altimeter/Encoder/Static Pressure System

> For use under IFR, the altimeter, encoder, and static pressure system must have been checked in the preceding **24 calendar months**.
