## ATS Routes

> ATS routes are **Air Traffic Services** Routes that include: 
- Victor (VOR) airways
- Jet (VOR) airways
- Q/T (RNAV) routes
- Colored (NDB) airways
- Arrival / Departure routes

### Victor Airways

> Extend from 1,200 AGL and up to (but not including) 17,999 MSL. 

- Note: The highest practical altitude is 17,000 feet on victor airways. 
- Also known as VOR Federal Airways
- 8nm wide, 4nm on either side of the airway
- Obstacle and terrain clearance is guaranteed
	- 1,000 feet in non-mountainous areas
	- 2,000 feet in mountainous areas

### Jet Routes

> Extend 18,000 MSL and up to and including 45,000 feet. 

### RNAV Routes

Painted in blue on IFR enroute charts. 

- "Q" Routes are *high-altitude* RNAV routes
- "T" Routes are *low-altitude* RNAV routes
	- Used for transition around busy terminal airspace
	- Also serve as replacements for other airways when underlying navaids were decommissioned

### Colored Airways

- Based on low and medium frequency navaids
- Named for colors:
	- Red
	- Green
	- Amber
	- Blue

## VORs

- All VORs have approximately the same *power* output, but are classified differently based on their *standard service volume*: 
	- Terminal VORs:
		- Usually on airports and used for insturment approaches
		- Lower power output than enroute VORs
		- Usable within **25nm** between 1000 AGL up to 12,000 AGL
	- Low VORs:
		- Usable within **40nm**: Above 1000 AGL, up to 18,000 MSL
		- Used for Victor airways
	- High VORs:
		- Usable within **40nm**: Above 1000 AGL, up to 14,500 MSL
		- Usable within **100nm**: Between 14,500 MSL and 17,999 MSL
		- Usable within **130nm**: Between 18,000 MSL and 45,000 MSL
		- Usable within **100nm**: Between 45,000 MSL and 60,000 MSL

> Always identify the VOR station you are using, as their are only aroudn 80 frequencies for VORs in the U.S.

- "Direct flights" are flights between navaids that do not have an airway between them. 
	- Up to 18,000 MSL with low VORs, the longest "direct" leg between two Low VORs is 80nm (2x the service volume of each Low VOR)
	- Between 14,500 and 17,999 MSL between two High VORs is 200m (100nm + 100nm service volume)

Note: Some airways may use VORs that are outside their standard service volume, but these will have been flight checked. 

- CDIs display *angular* deviation **when using VORs**
	- A full scale deflection of the CDI needle is 10 degrees off course (usually 2.5 degrees per dot)
	- 60 nm from the station: 
		- 1 degree deflection = 1 mile off course
		- 10 degree deflection = 10 miles off course
	- 30nm from the station: 
		- 1 degree deflection = 1/2 mile off course
		- 5 degree deflection = 2.5 miles off course
- When using **GPS**, the deviation is linear (not angular)

## Enroute IFR

- MEAs: Enroute IFR charts show miniumu enroute altitude for airways
	- These guarantee VOR coverage
	- These no *not* guarantee communications or radar coverage
- MOCAs: Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitudes
	- Guarantees VOR coverage within you are in 22nm 
	- Also guarantees obstruction clearance

> Use the standard East/West Odd/Even altitude rule when planning your IFR flight, or when flying through class G (uncommon). 
- ATC will be the last word on which altitude you fly. 

- In general, TRACONS handle the airspace within 30nm of an airport and up to 10,000-12,000 feet.
- ARTCC divide airspace between low sectors and high sectors at FL230
- Note: Wait a few minutes after frequency change before requesting a new altitude. 
- Inform ATC
	- If you are unable to maintain at least of 500 FPM
	- If your airspeed varies within 10 knots
	- If you have lost GPS or navigation equipment
- Plan flights around prohibited or restricted airspace by at least 3nm, unless you have permission
- Some MOAs have vertical extensions that extend up into Class A airspace called *air traffic control-assigned airspace*
	- Go ahead and file direct, and let ATC change your routing if necessary
