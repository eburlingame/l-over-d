## The Pilot's Role in the System

- The controller will: 
	1. Give first priority to:
		- Separating aircraft
		- Giving terrain, obstruction, and aircraft conflict alerts
	2. Second priority are given to *required* services that do not pertain to aircraft separation
	3. Additional service, to the extent possible
- The pilot in command: 
	- Has the responsibility to see and avoid other aircraft, terrain, and obstacles when in VFR conditions
- [Part 91.3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.3)
> ยง 91.3 Responsibility and authority of the pilot in command.
1. The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.
2. In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this part to the extent required to meet that emergency.
3. Each pilot in command who deviates from a rule under paragraph (b) of this section shall, upon the request of the Administrator, send a written report of that deviation to the Administrator.

- Note that a controller can declare an emergency on your behalf, if they feel the situation is getting unsafe. 

## Required Separation

- Within 40nm form an antenna
	- The separation from other aircraft can be as little as 5nm
	- The separation from obstructions can be as little as 3nm
	- Vertical separation is:
		- 1000 feet up to FL290
		- RVSM (Reduced vertical separation minimums) are required for flight above FL290
		- 2000 feet above FL410
- When outside of radar coverage
	- Required separation can be as much as 10 minutes
	- You may be required to make position reports in this case
	- Listen for "Radar contact lost," or "radar service terminated"

### Position Reports

Position reports include: 

1. Identification
2. Position
3. Time over reporting point
4. Altitude or flight level
5. Type of flight plan
6. ETA and name of next reporting point
7. Name of reporting point after next

> *Compulsory reporting points* are shown as solid black VOR on IFR charts: <br /><br />
![Compulsory reporting point](http://www.boldmethod.com/images/blog/quizzes/2016/10/the-hardest-ifr-quiz-youll-take-this-week/stem-1.jpg)

Note if you are *not* flying on an airway, the fixes used to define the route become compulsory reporting points. 

## Flying IFR

> You must file an IFR flight plan and receive and ATC clearance before entering controlled airspace in instrument meteorological conditions. 

However, you are on your own in uncontrolled (Class G) airspace.

Areas around airports are controlled by a TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control). 
- TRACONs airspace will usually extend to 10,000-12,000 feet	
- Traffic into airport not covered by a TRACON will be controlled by the Center.

- If there is no control tower on the field, *you* must close your flight plan after arrival. (Through ATC or flight service)

Note: Center's UHF frequencies are used by the military. 

- ATC will vector you with a headings that already have a wind-correction applied to it. 
	- If you are using GPS track for your navigation (for instance in a partial panel situation), advise the control to give you uncorrected heading vectors

## ATC Calls

1. Who you are calling (Seattle Center)
2. Who you are (N12382)
3. Your message (three thousand climbing niner thousand)

- Don't do these things
	- Don't say "with you"
	- Don't reply "roger" without a readback
	- Don't reference a instrument fix at a non-towered airport
	- No "Any traffic in the area please advise"

## Loss of Communication

If you lose communication in IMC: 

- Fly the route: 
	1. Last assigned by ATC
	2. The *expected* route in a further clearance
	3. Route *filed* in the flight plan
- Fly the altitude: 
	1. Last assigned by ATC
	2. Minimum enroute altitude (MEA)
	3. Expected altitude in a further clearance

> Set your transponder to 7600.

## Required IFR Reports

- Unforeseen stuff
	- All hazardous and/or unforecast weather
	- Safety information
	- Avionics malfunctions
	- Clearance deviation
	- If you are below the legal fuel requirement, advise a "minimum fuel status" 	- This is not an emergency
- Altitude
	- Leaving an altitude for a new altitude
	- Altitude change when flying VFR on top
- Performance
	- When you can't maintain a 500 FPM climb
	- Airspeed varies by 5% or 10 knots (whichever is greater)
- Holds
	- Time an altitude when reaching an assigned holding fix
	- When leaving a holding fix

### When not in radar contact

- Time and altitude when passing *mandatory reporting points*
- If you are going to miss your estimated time at the *next* reporting point, you have to call
- Leaving the FAF inbound on a non-precision approach
- Leaving the outer marker on a precision approach

- **R**outing
- **A**ltitude
- **F**requency
- **T**ransponder (squawk code)
