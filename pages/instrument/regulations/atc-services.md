## The Pilot's Role in the System

- The controller will: 
	1. Give first priority to:
		- Separating aircraft
		- Giving terrain, obstruction, and aircraft conflict alerts
	2. Second priority are given to *required* services that do not pertain to aircraft separation
	3. Additional service, to the extent possible
- The pilot in command: 
	- Has the responsibility to see and avoid other aircraft, terrain, and obstacles when in VFR conditions
- [Part 91.3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.3)
> ยง 91.3 Responsibility and authority of the pilot in command.
1. The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.
2. In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this part to the extent required to meet that emergency.
3. Each pilot in command who deviates from a rule under paragraph (b) of this section shall, upon the request of the Administrator, send a written report of that deviation to the Administrator.

- Note that a controller can declare an emergency on your behalf, if they feel the situation is getting unsafe. 

## Required Separation

- Within 40nm form an antenna
	- The separation from other aircraft can be as little as 5nm
	- The separation from obstructions can be as little as 3nm
	- Vertical separation is:
		- 1000 feet up to FL290
		- RVSM (Reduced vertical separation minimums) are required for flight above FL290
		- 2000 feet above FL410
- When outside of radar coverage
	- Required separation can be as much as 10 minutes
	- You may be required to make position reports in this case
	- Listen for "Radar contact lost," or "radar service terminated"

### Position Reports

Position reports include: 

1. Identification
2. Position
3. Time over reporting point
4. Altitude or flight level
5. Type of flight plan
6. ETA and name of next reporting point
7. Name of reporting point after next

> *Compulsory reporting points* are shown as solid black VOR on IFR charts: <br /><br />
![Compulsory reporting point](http://www.boldmethod.com/images/blog/quizzes/2016/10/the-hardest-ifr-quiz-youll-take-this-week/stem-1.jpg)

Note if you are *not* flying on an airway, the fixes used to define the route become compulsory reporting points. 

## Flying IFR

> You must file an IFR flight plan and receive and ATC clearance before entering controlled airspace in instrument meteorological conditions. 

However, you are on your own in uncontrolled (Class G) airspace.

Areas around airports are controlled by a TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control). 
- TRACONs airspace will usually extend to 10,000-12,000 feet	
- Traffic into airport not covered by a TRACON will be controlled by the Center.

- If there is no control tower on the field, *you* must close your flight plan after arrival. (Through ATC or flight service)

Note: Center's UHF frequencies are used by the military. 

- ATC will vector you with a headings that already have a wind-correction applied to it. 
	- If you are using GPS track for your navigation (for instance in a partial panel situation), advise the control to give you uncorrected heading vectors

- An altitude clearance stated "at pilot's discretion" means
	- You may climb/descend at any time
	- May use any climb or descent rate
	- May temporarily level off
	- You cannot return to altitude once you have passed through it
- IFR climbs and descents
	- Climb at an optimal rate until within 1,000 feet of your given altitude
	- Then, use 500 to 1500 FPM until leveling off
	- If you cannot climb or descend at at least 500 FPM, advise ATC
- "Resume own navigation":
	- Cancels the vectoring that your are being given
	- ATC expects you to resume on course, with the route given in your clearance

## ATC Calls

1. Who you are calling (Seattle Center)
2. Who you are (N12382)
3. Your message (three thousand climbing niner thousand)

- Don't do these things:
	- Don't say "with you"
	- Don't reply "roger" without a readback
	- Don't reference a instrument fix at a non-towered airport
	- No "Any traffic in the area please advise"

## Loss of Communication

If you lose communication in IMC: 

- Fly the route: 
	1. Last assigned by ATC
	2. The *expected* route in a further clearance
	3. Route *filed* in the flight plan
- Fly the altitude: 
	1. Last assigned by ATC
	2. Minimum enroute altitude (MEA)
	3. Expected altitude in a further clearance

> Set your transponder to 7600.

## Required IFR Reports

- Unforeseen stuff
	- All hazardous and/or unforecast weather
	- Safety information
	- Avionics malfunctions
	- Clearance deviation
	- If you are below the legal fuel requirement, advise a "minimum fuel status" 	- This is not an emergency
- Altitude
	- Leaving an altitude for a new altitude
	- Altitude change when flying VFR on top
- Performance
	- When you can't maintain a 500 FPM climb
	- Airspeed varies by 5% or 10 knots (whichever is greater)
- Holds
	- Time an altitude when reaching an assigned holding fix
	- When leaving a holding fix

### When Not in Radar Contact

- Time and altitude when passing *mandatory reporting points*
- If you are going to miss your estimated time at the *next* reporting point, you have to call
- Leaving the FAF inbound on a non-precision approach
- Leaving the outer marker on a precision approach

## IFR Clearances

> - **C**leared to
- **R**outing
- **A**ltitude
- **F**requency
- **T**ransponder (squawk code)

### Cleared as Filed

> If the controller tells you that you are "cleared as filed," then you should fly the route specified on your flight plan. 

- AIM calls this an "abbreviated clearance"
- A controller will always specify: 
	- The name of your destinations
	- Altitude to maintain
	- If a SID is appropriate:
		- The name of the departure
		- The transition to be used

### Clearance at an Uncontrolled Field

- If ATC can be reached on the ground, then get the clearance via the radio
- Without radio communication, you will be given a clearance over the phone with an FSS, which will specify:
	- A **release time**:
		- The departure airspace is not available until that time
	- A **void time**
		- You must depart prior to the void time
		- If not off by the void time, you *must* call the FSS and cancel your clearance
			- SAR will initiate after 30 minutes after the void time if you have not departed

### VFR On Top

> VFR on top is a clearance to operate in VMC above IFR weather. 

- To use VFR on top, you must:
	- Be instrument rated and current
	- Have filed an IFR flight plan
	- Have received an IFR clearance
- To use VFR on top:
	- You must request it explicitly from ATC
	- Must adhere to both IFR and VFR rules
	- Cruise altitude must be a VFR altitude 
	- Aircraft separation is the pilot's responsibility
	- Maintain VFR cloud clearance and viability requirements
	- You must report altitude changes to the controller
- May be used in lieu of an assigned altitude, which lets you conduct the cruise portion of your flight under VFR
- You cannot enter IMC

### Cruise Clearance

> A cruise clearance allows the pilot to manage their altitude. 

- Unlike VFR on top, you do no need to report altitude changes to ATC. 
- You are permitted to fly at altitude: 
	- Above the minimum for IFR
	- At or below the cruise altitude specified
- You are also permitted to descend to the approach procedure at your destination

### Block Altitude Clearance

> A block altitude clearance gives the pilot a vertical and/or horizontal bound from which they can fly as they please. 

- ATC will usually specify a vertical bound (altitude area), and a horizontal bound (for instance two radials of a VOR)
- Useful in turbulence
- No need to advise ATC of altitude changes as long as your remain within your block

### Popup IFR Clearance

> A popup IFR clearance is receiving a clearance in the air when you have not filed one beforehand. 

- Find the closest ARTCC frequency in your GPS, app, or on an approach plate
- They may ask you some flight plan form questions

## NOTAMs

> Notice to airmen (NOTAMs) contain amendments to procedure, location of obstacles, and other temporary information. 

- Types of NOTAMs:
	- FDC:
		- Chart/Procedure Amendments
		- Special Events
		- TFRs
	- D (Distant):
		- Navigational facilities
		- Airport notifications
	- Pointer:
		- References to highlight other NOTAMs
	- SAA (Special Activity Airspace):
		- Changes to published scheduled times for special airspace

## Loss of Communication Procedure

- If you lose radio communication while flying:
	- Check both radios
	- If you can communicate with other aircraft on the frequency, they may be able to relay your message
	- Look for an ARTCC frequency on the chart, or contact an FSS
	- Try 121.5 
	- Use a backup handheld transciever
	- In an emergency, you may try calling a ground station will a cell phone

### Regulations on Loss of Communications

The AIM states that there is no complete set of rules that governs what to do in every loss-of-communication scenario. 

> Pilots are encouraged to exercise their emergency authority to deviate from the rules *to the extent necessary* for safety. 

- The amount of rules governing pilot here is relatively small, but ATC has ample procedures on how to deal with it:
	- They will clear the airspace around the disabled aircraft

- FAR 91.185 describes what to do if 2-way radio communication is completely lost:
	- If in VMC:
		- Continue the flight under VFR and land visually at a suitable airport
	- If in IMC:
		- **Fly an appropriate route**:
			- Fly the route assigned in the most recent ATC clearance
			- If you were being vectored, fly direct to the fix or route specified in the vector clearance
			- If you *don't* have an advised route, fly the route that ATC said may be *expected*
			- Otherwise, fly the route as filed in your flight plan.
		- **Fly at the highest altitude among**: 
			- Your last assigned altitude
			- Altitude ATC advised you to *expect*
			- The minimum IFR altitude for your route segment
		- **Fly an appropriate approach**:
			- Fly an approach that ATC advised you to *expect*
			- If you have not *acknowledged* an approach, you may pick which one to use
			- Descent for the approach can begin:
				- Crossing the IAF (or IF)
				- As close as possible to the estimated time of arrival
			- Note you *cannot* start a descent until both conditions are met
	- If you are in a hold:
		- Leave the holding fix at the **expect further clearance (EFC) time**
