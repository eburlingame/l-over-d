## Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs)

Standardized transitions from the enroute to the terminal environment. 

- RNAV arrivals must be flown using an approved IFR GPS
- A descent of 250-350 feet per nm descent
	- At 120 knots, this is 500-700 fpm 

> Like a SID, a controller may issue a "descent via" clearance for a STAR:
- Here you are required to compily with the charts: 
	- Lateral path
	- Airspeed crossing restrictions
	- Altitude crossing restrictions

- Navigate vertically via the chart until you reach the lowest altitude on the STAR
- Do not turn inboard towards the airport unless you have been: 
	- Cleared for the approach, or
	- Cleared to intercept the final approach course

- The lowest altitude you will be assigned when vectoring is the minimum vectoring altitude (MVA)

- In a non-radar environment: 
	- Never leave an assigned altitude unless you are on a published route
	- Never descend below the altitude published on the chart
	- Don't descend below the MDA or DA unless you have the airport in sight
