## Visual Approach

You must have visual contact with the airport, or visual contract with an aircraft you are following. 

Note this is not a procedure, so there is *no* missed approach procedure. 

## Contact Approach

- A contact approach must be requested by the pilot
- Must be
	- Clear of clouds
	- 1 sm flight visibility 
	- At least 1 sm visibility reported at the field
- The airport must have an instrument approach procedure
- The pilot is responsible for obstruction clearance
- These approach are useful
	- If you are familiar with the area and don't wish to fly the entire approach
	- Weather is blocking the path of an instrument approach, but there is a clear path from another direction

Note, like a visual, this is not a procedure, so there is *no* missed approach procedure.
