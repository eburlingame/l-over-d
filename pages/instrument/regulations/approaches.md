## Types of Approaches

### Visual Approaches

You must have visual contact with the airport, or visual contract with an aircraft you are following. 

Note this is not a procedure, so there is *no* missed approach procedure. 

### Contact Approaches

- A contact approach must be requested by the pilot
- Must be
	- Clear of clouds
	- 1 sm flight visibility 
	- At least 1 sm visibility reported at the field
- The airport must have an instrument approach procedure
- The pilot is responsible for obstruction clearance
- These approach are useful
	- If you are familiar with the area and don't wish to fly the entire approach
	- Weather is blocking the path of an instrument approach, but there is a clear path from another direction

Note, like a visual, this is not a procedure, so there is *no* missed approach procedure. 

### Non-Precision Approaches

> A *non-precision approach* is a clearance to fly to a fix, and descend to an MSL altitude (the minimum descent altitude, MDA) until you see the airport, or you reach the missed approach point (MAP). 

- This approach differs from a precision approach as you are not given any vertical guidance on final
- Some MAPs are based on time and ground speed
- Some MAPs are based on a Navaid or fix
- Non-precision approaches assure obstacle clearance horizontally after the FAF until the MAP
- Descend from the FAF to the MDA as fast as practicable

#### VOR Approaches

- You must be VOR equipped, or have a GPS and the chart labels "or GPS"
- The "Five T's":
	- Time: Only needed if it is the IAF
	- Turn: Turn to intercept the desired course
	- Twist: Change the OBS to the outbound course
	- Throttle: Make the power reduction to approach speed
	- Talk: Report to ATC if a position report is required
- Practice "bracketing"
	- Make small, consistent corrections of heading
	- Don't make a correction until you have at least a 1 dot deviation of the CDI
	- Close to the station, use 10 degree brackets

#### NDB Approaches

- Most have a beacon on the airport, and some will have a beacon somewhere off the airport
- Most do not have a step-down fix, so descend to the MDA after the PT
- With no other NAVAIDs, you'll have to fly over the NDB, then tack outbound on the course, fly the PT, then fly the approach inbound

### Precision Approaches

> A *precision approach* is a clearance to intercept a glideslope and follow that vertical path to a MSL altitude called the decision altitude (DA). If the runway environment is not is sight at the DA, execute a missed approach. 

Note: The decision *height* (DH) is the height above the runway threshold, whereas the decision altitude (DA) which is an MSL altitude. 

### Approaches with Vertical Guidance

> A *approach with vertical guidance* provides both vertical and lateral guidance, but is less accurate than a precision approach. 

#### Baro-VNAV

- Flown using a coupled lateral and barometric pressure source
- Cannot be flown without the local altimeter setting, or on very cold days

#### LNAV / VNAV

- Approved GPSes can provide vertical and lateral guidance for the approach
- Will have minimums near a Baro-VNAV approach

#### LPV

- Will have minimums close to those of ILS approaches

#### LDA/GS (APV)

- Localizer directional aid with glide slope
- Also called APV approaches

## Approach Clearances

An *approach clearance* is a clearance to follow the procedure to descend to the MDA or DA, as charted. 

In order to descend below the MDA or DA (as to make a landing):
- The weather cannot be less than what is shown on the approach chart
- A normal descent to the runway must be made
- You must have the *runway environment* in sight, which includes:
	- 

Note if you have already started a descent from the MDA or DA and the weather worsens (say clouds roll over the field), you must go missed.

		- Minimums are shown for each aircraft category
		- List the:

			- Minimum flight visibility
			- Height above the touchdown zone at the MDA or DA (smaller)

- Approaches are named for the runway and type, and occasionally contain a letter if multiple approaches of the same type are present
	- Approaches also contain a letter if an approach serves more than one runway
	- Different approach types for the same runway have a distinguishing letter, "Z", "X", "Y", and so on
- TDZE = Touchdown Zone Elevation

### Procedure Turns

- Procedure turns are shown with a single arrow on one side of the approach course
- Usually flown at 30 or 45 degrees
- Flying a procedure turn is prohibited when: 
	- "NoPT" is printed: This nullifies the PT that is present on the chart, when the approach is flown from that direction
	- "Procedure Turn NA" (Not authorized) is printed: States that a PT may not be made no matter how we fly the approach
	- You are given *radar vector to final*
	- You are on a timed approach from a hold
- ATC clearance is required to make a procedure turn: 
	- When you are being given radar vectors
	- When you are cleared for the approach from a holding fix
- You must complete the PT above the altitude on the chart, and within the radius stated (usually 10nm)
- CNF: Computer Navigational Fix

- Flying a procedure turn
	- Turn to the prescribed heading for the PT on the chart
	- Start timing when the turn is complete
	- After 1 minute, make an opposite turn 180 degrees to intercept the opposite PT course
	- Intercept the final approach course

### Approach Categories

> Approach categories determine the weather minimums and DA or MDA for an approach, and are determined by the aircraft's approach speed.

They are determined by the Vref speed (if defined), or 1.3 * Vso:

<table class='ui celled table'>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Vref or Vso * 1.3</th>
			<th>Category</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td> < 91 knots</td>
		<td>A</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> 91 - 120 knots</td>
		<td>B</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> 121 - 140 knots</td>
		<td>C</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> 141 - 165 knots</td>
		<td>D</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Note: All helicopters and considered Category A. 

### ILS Categories

ILS approaches are broken up into different categories: 

- Category I
	- DH: 200 ft.
	- Visibility: 1/2 mile (or 1800 RVR if the runway has touchdown zone and centerline lighting [TDZL/CL])
- Category II
	- DH: 100 ft.
	- Visibility: 1200 ft RVR
- Category III
	- Cat. IIIa: 
		- DH: < 100 ft
		- Visibility: 699 > Ft. RVR
	- Cat. IIIb: 
		- DH: < 50 ft
		- Visibility: 150 to 699 Ft. RVR
	- Cat. IIIc: 
		- DH: 0 ft
		- Visibility: 0 Ft. RVR

## Marker Beacons

- Marker beacons produce an elliptical signal path
	- 1000 feet above it, the signal will be 4800 feet wide and 2400 feet deep
- Some marker beacon receivers have a sensitivity setting
- All marker beacons transmit of 75 Hz
- Outer markers
	- Outer markers are between 4-7 miles from the approach end of the runway
	- Intercepting the glide slope will usually occur around the outer marker
	- The outer marker produces a tone of dashes at 2 per second
- Middle markers
	- Not always present
	- Usually around 3500 feet from the arrival end of the runway
	- They are usually located around 200 feet on the glideslope, the standard ILS decision height
	- Transmit a dot and dash at 95 pairs per minute (higher pitch tone than outer marker)
- Inner marker
	- Used for Category II and III ILSes
	- Located between middle marker and outer marker
	- High pitch dots at 6 per second
	- Flashing white "A" on the panel
- Backcourse marker
	- Used on the back course of an approach, but are unusual
	- High pitch dots at 6 per second
	- Flashing white "A" on the panel
- Fan marker
	- Establishes a fix that is *not* on an LOC or ILS approach
	- High pitch dots at 6 per second
	- Flashing white "A" on the panel
	- Not many fan markers left
- Compass locators
	- NDB located at marker sites
	- Recieved for at least 15 miles
	- Two letter identifier (which are the same as the first and second letter of the localizer identifier)

## Localizers

> The localizer provides the lateral guidance for an ILS. 

- It is an extension
- Localizer antenna is usually 1000 feet from the departure end of the runway used
- There are only 40 ILS channels between 108.1 and 111.95 MHz
- The 3 letter identifier starts with "I", to avoid confusion with VOR stations
- A full needle deflection on a localized is usually 2.5 degrees, making the entire width 5 degrees wide
- The localizer is always 700 feet wide at the approach end of the runway
	- This means the localizer angle will vary depending on the length of the runway (longer runway = narrower localizer)
	- This means a full-scale deflection of the needle over the threshold means you are 350 off the centerline

- There are two similar kinds of systems other than localizers: 
	- LDA: Localizer Directional Aid
		- An actual localizer that is *not aligned* with the runway
		- It can't be called a localizer if the runway is more than 3 degrees off the localizer angle
		- Most LDAs do not have slide slopes
	- SDF: Simplified Directional Facility
		- No "I" before the station identifier
		- Either 6 or 12 degrees wides
		- May not be aligned with the runway
- There is not usually in practical difference in how LDAs, SDFs, and Localizers are used

- Localizers have two modulated signals: 
	- 150 Hz signal: Shaded side on charts
	- 90 Hz signal: Unshaded side on charts
- All localizers have a backcourses, which may be used for other approaches 
	- If you are flying inbound on the backcourse, you be required to correct *opposite* the CDI needle
	- There also exists *reverse sensing equipment* which will reverse the localizer signal for you

## Glider slope

- The glideslope antenna is positioned about 1000 feet down the side of the runway
- Usually situated so the glideslope is 55 feet above the threshold
- Usually a 3 degree descent angle
- The antenna will produce false glideslopes above the real one
	- The lowest false slope is more than >10 degrees from the horizontal
- At the outer marker, a full scale deflection is about 800 feet
- At the middle marker, a full scale deflection is about 100 feet
- To find the approximate descent rate needed to matain the 3 degree glide path: 
	- Computer ground speed / 2 * 10 
	- E.g. 100 / 2 * 10 = 500 feet per minute
- Only use 50 RPM increments to bring you back to the glidepath when deviations

## Unusual Approaches

- A *side step* maneuver is used when an approach for another runway is used
	- The runways must be no more than 1200 feet apart
	- "Cleared for the 10R approach, side step to runway 10L"
- Timed approaches from a holding fix
	- Can only be made at a control towered airport

## ADF Tracking

- If you're using an ADF for a PT: 
	- Tune the ADF to the outer marker
	- If a 45 degree PT was made, make your 180 degree PT and fly inbound to the FA course
	- When the ADF needle is 45 degrees off of N, then you are on the final approach course
- Tracking a bearing inbound
	- Know the difference between the heading of the aircraft and the desired bearing
	- Look for that difference  **off of the N** point on the fixed card ADF
	- The needle will start *closer* to the nose and move *away* from it
- Tracking a bearing outbound
	- Know the difference between the heading of the aircraft and the desired bearing
	- Look for that difference  **off of the S** point on the fixed card ADF
	- The needle with start *away* from the nose and move towards it
- Tracking a bearing with wind correction
	- If tracking inbound (with the needle on N), and starts to drift to the left (left crosswind)
	- Add a wind correction angle (for instance 10 degrees) and turn 30 degrees left 
	- Recapture the ADF when the needle is is *20* degrees off the to the right (30 degree turn - 10 degree wind correction)
	- Turn 20 degrees to the right and observe the needle is 10 degrees to the right (the wind correction angle), and you should maintain the track
