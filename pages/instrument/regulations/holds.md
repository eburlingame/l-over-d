Holds can occur at any point in an IFR flight. 

- Enroute
	- You must hold if you have not reached your destination and you have reached you clearance limit (E.g. expect additional clearance at 1430)
- Departure
	- Some departure procedures will have you climb in a hold
- Approach
	- Many approach procedures use a hold for the course reversal (often instead of a procedure turn)
	- All missed procedures will end in a hold
- Holding pattern protected airspace depends on:
	- Altitude
	- Fix-to-NAVAID distance
	- Airspeed
- They compensate for minimum of 50 knot winds

## Controller-Specified Holds

- Direction of hold
	- N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
- Holding fix
- Bearing or airway
- Leg length (If DME or RNAV)
- Turning direction (if it is left)
- Expect further clearance time

## Standard Holding Pattern

- Right turns around a fix
- Maximum speeds depend on altitude: 
	- Up to 6,000: 200 knots
	- 6 to 14,000: 230 knots
	- Above 14,000: 265 knots
- Some holding patterns will have different maximum speeds charted
- **1 minute inbound leg** (1.5 minutes above 14,000 feet)
- Some will specify a RNAV leg length or DME distance instead of time
- ON a VOR: 
	- Start the outbound turn at the reversal of the TO/FROM indicator
	- Hold heading when abeam the fix
- Use standard rate, but not more than 30 degrees

## Holding Pattern Entry

![Holding pattern entry](http://code7700.com/images/holding_pattern.jpg)

### Teardrop Entry 

- Track to the station, then at the fix turn 30 degrees right and fly for one minute
- Turn to the outbound course, then turn right towards the inbound leg

### Direct Entry

- Track to the station, then make a right turn to enter the hold

### Parallel Entry

- Track to the station, then intercept the inbound course of the hold outbound
- Then make a left turn more than 180 degrees and track the inbound course


- Rule of thumb
	- Put your *left* thumb (for a left holding pattern) over the top left of the HI to mark the teardrop section
		- The other two sections fall into place
	- Put your *right* thumb (for a right holding pattern) over the top right of the HI to mark the teardrop section
- You can also chose to always fly a teardrop or parallel entry, if you are on the side opposite the direct entry side
