Holds can occur at any point in an IFR flight. 

- Enroute
	- You must hold if you have not reached your destination and you have reached you clearance limit (E.g. expect additional clearance at 1430)
- Departure
	- Some departure procedures will have you climb in a hold
- Approach
	- Many approach procedures use a hold for the course reversal (often instead of a procedure turn)
	- All missed procedures will end in a hold
