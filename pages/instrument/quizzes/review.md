*Cumulonimbus* clouds contain the greatest amount of turbulence.

Ice can reduce lift by as much as *30*% and increase drag by as much as *40*%.

In partial panel, level flight is indicated when the *VSI* reverses its trend, the [*airspeed, airspeed indicator* stops moving, and the *altimeter*] stops moving. 

When simultaneous parallel approaches are in use (PRM approached), radar advisories are received over the *tower* frequency.

In climbing out after takeoff, you can expect ice to accumulate *under the wings* due to the high *AOA*.

Frontal waves normally occur in slow moving *cold* fronts or *stationary* fronts.

While taxiing, the *magnetic compass, compass* should swing freely and show normal headings.

When reading back an airborne IFR clearance, only read back the parts containing *altitude* assignment or *vectors*, or any parts requiring *verification*. 

During a dual VOR check, the needles should center within 4 degrees of the *two indicated radials, each other*.

The very outskirts of a microburst feature an *increasing headwind*, and an unexplained *increase in performance*.

An instructor may only log instrument time when he is giving instrument instruction in *actual* instrument conditions.

Haze creates the illusion of being a *greater* distance from the runway than you actually are, causing you fly a *lower approach*.

A low-level temperature inversion is often associate with *wind shear*.

VFR-on-top will only be assigned if the pilot *requests* it.

The glideslope prescribed by a runway's PAPI assures obstruction clearance within *4nm* of the runway threshold, and within +/- *10* degrees of the runway centerline.

The jetstream is a wind of *50* knots or greater. 

The dry adiabatic lapse rate is *3* degrees per *1000',1000 ft*.

The standard atmosphere is *15* degrees C at the surface, and lapses *2* degrees per *1000',1000 ft*, making it a *stable* atmosphere. 

A thunderstorm has reached the *mature* stage when precipitation begins to fall at the surface.

A squall line will feature sudden increases in wind speed up to *16* knots, rising to *22* knots or more, and lasting for as long as *1* minute.

*Lightning* is always associated with a thunderstorm.

From the time the microburst hits the ground, it can last as long as *15* minutes.

Downdrafts from a microburst can be as much as *6000* feet per minute.

An aircraft may experience a total shear of *90* knots in a microburst.

If a tailplane stall is detected, the pilot should immediately [*retract the flaps*, *increase power, add power*, and *pull up*]. 

*Leading edge* icing is far less of a concern than icing on the *upper surface*.

Cycle deicing boots *immediately* after visually confirming ice buildup on the leading edge. Also, continue to cycle boots *after leaving* icing conditions to ensure the leading edge is clear.

If roll upset occurs, the pilot should *increase, add* power and *decrease, lower, reduce* the angle of attack.

Ice is most likely to first accumulate on the *tailplane*.

The most likely time to find low-level wind shear is *before* the passage of a warm front, and *after* the passage of a cold front. 

METAR cloud reports are shown in altitude *AGL*.

A TAF covers a radius of approximately *5 sm* around the runway complex.

A TAF will report “VRB” when the winds are *6* knots or less.

MVFR is visibility between *3* and *5* s.m.

Winds aloft are reported in *true* degrees. 

On a winds aloft forecast, if the wind speed is greater than *100* knots, then *50* is added to the wind direction (making it an impossible direction), and *100* is subtracted from the wind speed. 

The maximum forecast period for AIRMETs is *6* hours. They are also issued every *6* hours.

XXX on a high-altitude weather prognostic chart means the cloud bases are below *25000*.

Significant weather prognostic charts are *forecasts*.

A new ATIS will be created upon report of *official* weather, regardless of its contents.

An ATIS report which omits the ceiling and sky conditions means that the ceiling is more than *5000* feet, and the visibility is greater than *5* miles.
