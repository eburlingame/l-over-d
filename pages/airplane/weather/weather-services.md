### Convective Outlook

- Thunderstorm forecast

### Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)

- Doesn't really tell you what's going on in the clouds

### METARs

- METARs are old information
- Compare with forecast and see if they were


### PIREPS

- Beware of old pilot reports
- The type of aircraft should color your interpretation of the report
	- Larger airplanes can handle more turbulence
	- Faster airplanes will spend far less time in icing, and their skin is usually warmer due to the the friction of fast moving air

### Area Forecasts

- Occluded fronts usually means *wind shear*
- Look for mountain wave
	- Winds increasing with altitude above a ridge and above 20-30 knots

## Cockpit Systems

- Airborne Weather Radar
	- Reflects off precipitation
	- Look for a steep change in precipitation return
	- Adjust the tilt
		- Note that snow (which usually occurs high in clouds) does not give much radar return
	- Attenuation occurs when heavy rainfall returns most of the radar signal
		- Then, you may only be able to see 5-10 miles ahead
		- You have no idea what lingers beyond the effective range
		- To help, adjust the tilt to pick up some ground returns
			- If you aren't getting ground return in the area behind the storm, you know you can't pick precip either
- Stormscope/Strikefinder
	- Detects lighting
	- Don't point the airplane towards discharges
	- Isn't affected by attenuation
	- Clear the screen and observe the rate of reappearing strikes
- NextRAD weather radar
	- They are always history
	- Lower resolution than airborne radar
