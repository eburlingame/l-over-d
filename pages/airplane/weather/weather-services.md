### Convective Outlook

- Thunderstorm forecast

### Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)

- Doesn't really tell you what's going on in the clouds

### METARs

- METARs are old information
- Compare with forecast and see if they were


### PIREPS

- Beware of old pilot reports
- The type of aircraft should color your interpretation of the report
	- Larger airplanes can handle more turbulence
	- Faster airplanes will spend far less time in icing, and their skin is usually warmer due to the the friction of fast moving air

### Area Forecasts

- Occluded fronts usually means *wind shear*
- Look for mountain wave
	- Winds increasing with altitude above a ridge and above 20-30 knots
