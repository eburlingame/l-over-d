- The amount of water the air can hold *doubles* with every 11 degree increase in temperature

## Surface Weather Prognosis Chart

- Isobars are shown, which are lines of *constant pressure*

## Upper Level Constant Pressure Charts

- 500mb chart is around 18,000 feet
- The entire chart is **constant pressure**, and the lines on the chart represent altitudes
- Highs and low refer to altitudes, not pressures

- The wind usually parallels the contours
- Cold air aloft will be brought down, counter clockwise around the low, and drawn over warm air at the surface
	- This causes instability
	- The more rapidly the air cools, the greater the instability
	- Moist air wraps up and around the low
	- Sometimes called "upper level support"
