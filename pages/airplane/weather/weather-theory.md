- The amount of water the air can hold *doubles* with every 11 degree increase in temperature

## Surface Weather Prognosis Chart

- Isobars are shown, which are lines of *constant pressure*

## Upper Level Constant Pressure Charts

- 500mb chart is around 18,000 feet
- The entire chart is **constant pressure**, and the lines on the chart represent altitudes
- Highs and low refer to altitudes, not pressures

- The wind usually parallels the contours
- Cold air aloft will be brought down, counter clockwise around the low, and drawn over warm air at the surface
	- This causes instability
	- The more rapidly the air cools, the greater the instability
	- Moist air wraps up and around the low
	- Sometimes called "upper level support"

## Below Minimum Weather

- Most ILS approaches have a 200 ft DH and require a 1/2 mile visibility, or 1800 ft. RVR (about 3/8 of a mile)
- Most non-precision approaches have 400-600 foot MDAs and 1 mile visibility
- NDB minimums are typically 500-900 ft. AGL, can be as low as 350 AGL without terrain
- VOR minimums are could be as low as 250 ft MDA


- Most below-minimum conditions are caused by fog
	- Advection fog: Warmer moist air (perhaps off a body of water) moves over cold ground
	- Radiation fog (ground fog): 
		- Forms on clear nights with light or no wind
		- A small temp/dewpoint spread
		- The lower you go, the *less* you see
- Fog cannot be "burned off" by the sun if there are overlaying cloud layers above the fog
- When taking off in fog, pick a takeoff alternate that has weather above landing minimums

- Warm rain falling into colder air may also produce fog
- Rain also creates low "scud"
	- 1 sm vis, 200 scattered, 800 ovc
	- Scud can preclude a circling approach
- The vast majority of IFR accidents occurs on approach, more so even on ILS approaches

> It is the pilot's prerogative to shoot an approach when the airport reports below-minimum weather. 

- FAR 91.175 states that the *flight visibility* must be at least the minimums listed on the chart, and only the pilot can judge the flight visibility

> As a general rule, do *not* shoot more than one approach (and definitely don't try to "make the approach work"). Also, don't attempt an approach if the airport is reporting below minimum weather. 

## Turbulence 

- Try to avoid all fair-weather cumulus, if you can
- Categories
	- Light: 
		- Momentary changes in altitude or attitude
		- Occupants may feel a strain against the seat belts
	- Light Chop:
		- Rhythmic light turbulence
	- Moderate:
		- Definite strains against your belts
		- Unsecured items are dislodged
	- Moderate chop: 
		- Rapid jumps or jolts *without* appreciable attitude changes
	- Severe:
		- Substantial changes in attitude and altitude
		- Strained tightly against your belts
	- Extreme Turbulence
		- Violently tossed about
		- Practically impossible to control
		- Damage possible 
- Rotor:
	- Wind increasing with altitude against a ridge, causing wave on the downwind side
	- Note that an MEA will put you 2,000 feet above the ridge level
- Significant turbulence in occluded fronts and troughs aloft
- Don't fly at an MEA when it is within 4000-6000 feet of your airplane service ceiling
- Fly Va or maneuvering speed in turbulence
	- The speed at which the airplane will stall before the critical load factor is reached
	- The maneuvering speed decreases as weight decreases, due to the relative wing loadings
