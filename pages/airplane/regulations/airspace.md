## Airspace Classes

Airspace can be divided into main types, defined by ICAO:

- Controlled
	- A
	- B
	- C
	- D
	- E
- Uncontrolled
	- G
- Special Use
	- Restricted
	- MOA
	- Warning
- Other
	- Military Training Route
	- TFRs

### Controlled

#### Class A

> Begins at 18,000 MSL, *pressure altitude* (the altimeter reading when set to 29.92" Hg)

- FL350 = 35,000 feet
- IFR only:
	- Must be IFR rated and equipped
	- Must receive an IFR clearance
	- Maintain two-way radio contact


#### Class B

The airspace around the busiest airports. 

- Extends
	- Usually extends from the surface to 10,000 feet. 
- Speed limits
	- Aircraft must maintain 250 KIAS or below while *inside* class B
	- Aircraft operating *below* the class B are required to maintain 200 KIAS or less


- You must receive explicit authorization from ATC that you are permitted to enter the bravo airspace
	- Usually involves specific instructions
	- You will often be given a squawk code
- Must maintain two-way radio contact while in the airspace
- Must have a Mode-C transponder operating

- Entry without a transponder
	- You may operate in class B airspace *without* an operating transponder if you request permission from the controlling facility at least 1 hour before entry
	- You may also operate in class B airspace without a *mode C* transponder, if you request permission. These arrangements do no need to be made in advanced. 


#### Class C

#### Class D

#### Class E

### Uncontrolled

#### Class G

### Special Use

#### Restricted

#### MOA

#### Warning

### Other

#### Military Training Routes
