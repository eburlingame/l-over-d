## Stability

> **Stability** is the quality of an airplane to return to a regular flight attitude after being subjected to some outside influence. 

## Center of Gravity and Center of Lift

> The **center of gravity** is the "balancing point" of the airplane

- It largely influences the longitudinal (pitch) stability of the airplane. 
- The more area there is *behind* the CG, the more the airplane wants to weather-vain back into the wind

![CG, CL](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8pHMC.png)

> The **center of lift** is the point from which the lift vector extends.

- It is usually placed slightly aft of the CG to promote a nose-down movement in a stall 
- The tail provides a down force to counteract the "nose-heaviness" of the aircraft

### CG Placement and Performance

- Effects of a **forward** CG: 
	- Increased pitch stability
	- Heavier elevator control forces are required
	- The "heavier" nose requires more downward force to be produced by the tail
		- This downdraft must be matched by lift from the main wing, causes you to fly at a higher angle of attack
		- This higher angle of attack increases your induced drag, and thus *decreases* your cruise performance
- Effects of an **aft** CG:
	- Pitch stability is *reduced*
	- Lighter elevator control forces are required
	- Airplane will tend to "wander" from level flight
	- If the CG is *behind* the center of lift, then the aircraft will be unrecoverable from a stall
	- A lower angle of attack is required to maintain level flight, giving you *increased* cruise performance

## Dihedral

> **Dihedral** is the upward angle of the wings, where the wing tips are higher than the wing root. 

When the aircraft is banked in an uncoordinated turn, dihedral places the inside wing is at a higher angle of attack. The inside wing then generates more lift, and thus promotes a roll back to level flight.

## Load Factor

> The *load factor* is the ratio between the upward (lift) and downward (gravity and centripetal force) forces that the wings are subjected to.

- During straight and level, unaccelerated flight the load factor is 1
- During a *level* turn however, the load factor will be greater
	- The lift vector is no long pointed straight up
	- The vertical component of the lift vector is reduced, so a greater amount of lift is required to maintain altitude
	- The horizontal component of the lift vector accelerates the aircraft into the turn

## Stalls and Spins

> A **stall** occurs when the main lifting surface exceeds the critical angle of attack. 

- Increasing the angle of attack causes the airflow over the top of the wing to become turbulent, and the boundary layer detaches from the surface of the wing.
- This causes a loss of lift
- The **critical angle of attack** is a constant. It is not affected by airspeed or aircraft loading. 

> A **spin** is a type of stall that results from asymmetrically stalling the aircraft's wings. 

Spins occur during uncoordinated flight, often during skidding turn. 

![Skid](http://www.boldmethod.com/images/learn-to-fly/aerodynamics/slip-skid/skid-3d.jpg)

> During a skidding turn, the inside wing is traveling *slower* than the outside wing. 

If the inside wing exceeds its critical angle of attack, then that wing will stall, however the outboard wing will still be generating lift. 

Proper stall recovery technique will be documented in the aircraft's POH or AFM, but usually includes:

1. Power to idle
2. Neutral ailerons
3. **Apply full opposite rudder**
4. Apply forward elevator
5. Recover from the dive
