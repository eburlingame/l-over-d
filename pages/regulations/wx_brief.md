# Weather Briefings

If we conduct a flight *outside of final glide of an airport* we must obtain a weather briefing before our flight. 

There is no long a legal requirement to do so, but it is [a good idea](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2014/october/14/weather-briefings-for-the-internet-age). 

- `1800-WX-BRIEF`: Calling a FSS
- [1800WxBrief.com](https://www.1800wxbrief.com/Website/#!/): Online

We can obtain a weather breifing for a *point* or an intended *route*.

## Weather Reports

### METARs

Meteorological reports are *observations* for a particular location. 

#### Cloud Coverage

<table class="ui table">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>CLR</th>
			<th>FEW</th>
			<th>SCT</th>
			<th>BRK</th>
			<th>OVC</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>0/8</td>
			<td>1/8 to 2/8</td>
			<td>3/8 to 4/8</td>
			<td>5/8 to 6/8</td>
			<td>7/8 to 8/8</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

A *ceiling* is described as the lowest **BRK** or **OVC** layer.

### TAFs
