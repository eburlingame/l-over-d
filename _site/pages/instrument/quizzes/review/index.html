*Cumulonimbus* clouds contain the greatest amount of turbulence.

Ice can reduce lift by as much as *30*% and increase drag by as much as *40*%.

In partial panel, level flight is indicated when the *VSI* reverses its trend, the [*airspeed, airspeed indicator* stops moving, and the *altimeter*] stops moving. 

When simultaneous parallel approaches are in use (PRM approached), radar advisories are received over the *tower* frequency.

In climbing out after takeoff, you can expect ice to accumulate *under the wings* due to the high *AOA*.

Frontal waves normally occur in slow moving *cold* fronts or *stationary* fronts.

While taxiing, the *magnetic compass, compass* should swing freely and show normal headings.

When reading back an airborne IFR clearance, only read back the parts containing *altitude* assignment or *vectors*, or any parts requiring *verification*. 

During a dual VOR check, the needles should center within 4 degrees of *the two indicated radials, each other*.

The very outskirts of a microburst feature an *increasing headwind*, and an unexplained *increase in performance*.

An instructor may only log instrument time when he is giving instrument instruction in *actual* instrument conditions.

Haze creates the illusion of being a *greater* distance from the runway than you actually are, causing you fly a *lower approach*.

A low-level temperature inversion is often associate with *wind shear*.

VFR-on-top will only be assigned if the pilot *requests* it.

The glideslope prescribed by a runway's PAPI assures obstruction clearance within *4nm* of the runway threshold, and within +/- *10* degrees of the runway centerline.

The jetstream is a wind of *50* knots or greater. 

The dry adiabatic lapse rate is *3* degrees per *1000',1000 ft*.

The standard atmosphere is *15* degrees C at the surface, and lapses *2* degrees per *1000',1000 ft*, making it a *stable* atmosphere. 

A thunderstorm has reached the *mature* stage when precipitation begins to fall at the surface.

A squall line will feature sudden increases in wind speed up to *16* knots, rising to *22* knots or more, and lasting for as long as *1* minute.

*Lightning* is always associated with a thunderstorm.

When you fly into a thunderstorm, above all else, attempt to keep the airplane *level*.

From the time the microburst hits the ground, it can last as long as *15* minutes.

Downdrafts from a microburst can be as much as *6000* feet per minute.

An aircraft may experience a total shear of *90* knots in a microburst.

If a tailplane stall is detected, the pilot should immediately [*retract the flaps*, *increase power, add power*, and *pull up*]. 

*Leading edge* icing is far less of a concern than icing on the *upper surface*.

Cycle deicing boots *immediately* after visually confirming ice buildup on the leading edge. Also, continue to cycle boots *after leaving* icing conditions to ensure the leading edge is clear.

If roll upset occurs, the pilot should *increase, add* power and *decrease, lower, reduce* the angle of attack.

Ice is most likely to first accumulate on the *tailplane*.

The most likely time to find low-level wind shear is *before* the passage of a warm front, and *after* the passage of a cold front. 

METAR cloud reports are shown in altitude *AGL*.

A TAF covers a radius of approximately *5 sm* around the runway complex.

A TAF will report “VRB” when the winds are *6* knots or less.

MVFR is visibility between *3* and *5* s.m.

Winds aloft are reported in *true* degrees. 

On a winds aloft forecast, if the wind speed is greater than *100* knots, then *50* is added to the wind direction (making it an impossible direction), and *100* is subtracted from the wind speed. 

The maximum forecast period for AIRMETs is *6* hours. They are also issued every *6* hours.

XXX on a high-altitude weather prognostic chart means the cloud bases are below *25000*.

Significant weather prognostic charts are *forecasts*.

A new ATIS will be created upon report of *official* weather, regardless of its contents.

An ATIS report which omits the ceiling and sky conditions means that the ceiling is more than *5000* feet, and the visibility is greater than *5* miles.

A pilot must *request* a contact approach, and have at least *1 mi, 1 mile* visibility and remain *clear of clouds*. 

A Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM) approach may require monitoring of two *comm, communication* frequencies.

If there is penetration of the obstacle identification surface (OIS) for an ILS runway equipped with MALSR, the published approach *visibility* requirements will be no lower than *3/4* s.m.

Abrupt head movement during a prolonged constant rate turn in IMC or simulated instrument conditions can cause the *coriolis illusion*.

AN IFR-approved GPS navigator will include a *flight manual supplement* which contains the limitations and operating procedures applicable to the equipment installed.

The jet stream moves *south* in the winter, and is *stronger* than it is in the summer.

As temperature increases, your true airspeed (TAS) *increases*.

The alternate static source in most systems will read *lower* pressure than the normal static source. 

For level flight using constant thrust, the *attitude indicator, ai* would be least appropriate for determining the need for a pitch change. 

For each 1/2 mile deviation off of a desired arc, plan to correct between *10* and *20* degrees. 

In a technically advanced aircraft, a warning message is a flash *red* indication with a repeating tone. 

Tunnel vision and cyanosis are symptoms of *hypoxia*.

To operate under IFR, a pilot must file an IFR flight plan and receive a clearance prior to *entering controlled airspace*.

On a composite flight plan, transitioning from VFR to IFR should involve contacting a *FSS* and requesting they close your VFR portion, and request ATC clearance. 

An abbreviated clearance will always contain the [*destination airport, destination*, and *route*].

If departing IFR from an uncontrolled airfield, the pilot must advise ATC *asap, as soon as possible*, but no later than *30* minutes, if they have not departed by the void time. 

You should state your position on the airport when calling the tower for a takeoff clearance when departing from a *runway intersection*. 

Parallel ILS approaches provide a minimum of *1 1/2, 1-1/2, 1.5* s.m. radar separation between aircraft on the adjacent localizer course. 

You cannot descend below the MDA on a non-precision approach until reaching the *visual decent point, vdp*, if the approach has one. This keeps you clear of obstacles on your final descent to the runway. 

On a non-precision approach, you should be descending less than *1000* FPM at the MDA, and less than *500* FPM when you are *500* feet above the touchdown zone. 

A contact approach may be used in lieu of a *SIAP, instrument approach*.

If the ILS outer marker is inoperative, you may substitute a [*compass locator*  or *precision radar*]. *DME*, may also be substituted for the OM, but only when specified in the procedure.

If you experience turbulence that causes slight, rapid and somewhat rhythmic bumpiness without appreciable changes in altitude or attitude, the report *light chop*. If the turbulence _does_ cause erratic changes in altitude and/or attitude, then report *light turbulence*.

If the attitude indicator's horizon bar tilts more than *5* degrees while making taxi turns, assume the instrument is unreliable. 

A stabilized approach is required *1000* feet above *TDZE*.
